# Multi-Shot Prompting

## Overview

Multi-shot prompting is a technique where an AI model is provided with multiple examples (input-output pairs) before being asked to perform a similar task. This approach helps the model understand complex patterns, variations, and nuances that might not be apparent from a single example.

## Key Characteristics

- **Multiple Examples**: Several input-output pairs are provided as demonstrations
- **Pattern Recognition**: The model learns complex patterns and variations
- **Robust Learning**: Multiple examples help the model generalize better
- **Complex Task Handling**: Effective for tasks with multiple possible approaches
- **Consistency Training**: Helps establish consistent output patterns

## When to Use Multi-Shot Prompting

- Complex tasks requiring multiple approaches
- When consistency across variations is important
- Tasks with multiple valid output formats
- When one-shot results are inconsistent
- For tasks that benefit from seeing different examples
- When you need to establish specific patterns or rules

## Example

### User Prompt
```
Q: What is the capital of France? 
A: Paris
Q: What is the capital of Germany?
A: Berlin
Q: What is the capital of Italy?
```

### Expected AI Response
```
Rome
```

## Detailed Example with Context

### Complete Prompt
```
Here are some examples of capital cities:

Q: What is the capital of France? 
A: Paris
Q: What is the capital of Germany?
A: Berlin
Q: What is the capital of Italy?
```

### Expected AI Response
```
Rome
```

## Advanced Multi-Shot Examples

### Mathematical Operations with Different Types
```
Q: What is 5 + 3?
A: 8
Q: What is 10 - 4?
A: 6
Q: What is 7 ร 2?
A: 14
Q: What is 15 รท 3?
A: 5
Q: What is 9 + 7?
```

### Text Classification with Sentiment
```
Q: "I love this movie!"
A: Positive
Q: "This is terrible."
A: Negative
Q: "The weather is okay."
A: Neutral
Q: "This product is amazing!"
A: Positive
Q: "I'm disappointed with the service."
```

### Code Generation Patterns
```
Q: Create a function to add two numbers
A: 
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

Q: Create a function to subtract two numbers
A:
def subtract_numbers(a, b):
    return a - b

Q: Create a function to multiply two numbers
A:
def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b

Q: Create a function to divide two numbers
```

## Advantages

1. **Better Understanding**: Multiple examples provide comprehensive pattern recognition
2. **Consistency**: Helps establish consistent output patterns across variations
3. **Robustness**: Model learns to handle different scenarios and edge cases
4. **Complex Patterns**: Can learn sophisticated relationships and rules
5. **Generalization**: Better at applying learned patterns to new, similar tasks

## Limitations

1. **Token Usage**: Requires more tokens for multiple examples
2. **Cost**: Higher computational cost due to longer prompts
3. **Overfitting Risk**: May become too specific to the provided examples
4. **Example Quality**: Effectiveness depends heavily on example quality and variety
5. **Context Window**: May approach model's context limitations

## Best Practices

- **Diverse Examples**: Include examples that cover different scenarios and edge cases
- **Consistent Format**: Maintain consistent input-output format across examples
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on high-quality, representative examples
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple examples and gradually increase complexity
- **Testing**: Test with different example sets to ensure robustness

## Use Cases

- **Complex Problem Solving**: Mathematical problems with multiple steps
- **Language Translation**: Multiple language pairs and contexts
- **Code Generation**: Different programming patterns and styles
- **Text Analysis**: Various types of content classification
- **Creative Writing**: Different writing styles and formats

## Comparison with Other Techniques

| Technique | Examples | Complexity | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| Zero-shot | 0 | Low | Simple, direct tasks |
| One-shot | 1 | Medium | Format consistency |
| Multi-shot | 2+ | High | Complex patterns |

## Example Variations

### Programming Language Translation
```
Q: Convert this Python code to JavaScript: print("Hello")
A: console.log("Hello");
Q: Convert this Python code to JavaScript: x = 5
A: let x = 5;
Q: Convert this Python code to JavaScript: if x > 0:
```

### Mathematical Word Problems
```
Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, how many does he have left?
A: 3 apples
Q: If a train travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is its speed?
A: 30 miles per hour
Q: If a rectangle has length 8 and width 4, what is its area?
```
