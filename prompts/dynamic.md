# Dynamic Prompting

## Overview

Dynamic prompting is a technique where prompts contain variables or placeholders that can be replaced with specific values at runtime. This approach allows for the creation of reusable, customizable prompts that can be adapted to different contexts, users, or scenarios without rewriting the entire prompt.

## Key Characteristics

- **Variable Placeholders**: Uses placeholders like `{variable_name}` in prompts
- **Runtime Substitution**: Variables are replaced with actual values when the prompt is used
- **Reusability**: Same prompt template can be used with different values
- **Personalization**: Allows for customized responses based on user context
- **Scalability**: Efficient for handling multiple similar requests

## When to Use Dynamic Prompting

- When you need to personalize responses for different users
- For applications that handle multiple similar requests
- When you want to create reusable prompt templates
- For systems that need to adapt content based on context
- When you want to maintain consistency while allowing customization

## Example

### Template with Variables
```
Hello {username}, please explain the topic: {topic}.
```

### Sample Filled Version
```
Hello Alex, please explain the topic: Photosynthesis.
```

## Detailed Examples

### Basic Dynamic Prompt
```
Template: "Hello {username}, please explain the topic: {topic}."

Variables:
- username = "Alex"
- topic = "Photosynthesis"

Result: "Hello Alex, please explain the topic: Photosynthesis."
```

### Advanced Dynamic Prompt with Multiple Variables
```
Template: "Hello {username}, welcome to {platform}! Today we'll be learning about {subject}. Your current level is {level}."

Variables:
- username = "Sarah"
- platform = "NoteWise"
- subject = "Machine Learning"
- level = "Intermediate"

Result: "Hello Sarah, welcome to NoteWise! Today we'll be learning about Machine Learning. Your current level is Intermediate."
```

## Variable Types and Usage

### User-Specific Variables
```
{username} - User's name
{user_id} - Unique user identifier
{user_role} - User's role or permission level
{user_preferences} - User's preferences or settings
```

### Context-Specific Variables
```
{topic} - Current topic or subject
{difficulty} - Difficulty level
{language} - Preferred language
{format} - Desired output format
```

### System Variables
```
{timestamp} - Current date and time
{platform} - Platform or application name
{version} - System version
{environment} - Current environment (dev, prod, etc.)
```

## Implementation Examples

### Customer Service Response
```
Template: "Dear {customer_name}, thank you for contacting {company_name} regarding your {issue_type}. Our team will address your concern about {specific_issue} within {response_time}."

Variables:
- customer_name = "John Smith"
- company_name = "TechCorp"
- issue_type = "billing inquiry"
- specific_issue = "unexpected charges"
- response_time = "24 hours"

Result: "Dear John Smith, thank you for contacting TechCorp regarding your billing inquiry. Our team will address your concern about unexpected charges within 24 hours."
```

### Educational Content Generation
```
Template: "Hello {student_name}, here's your personalized lesson on {subject} at the {level} level. Today we'll cover {topic} with {duration} of content."

Variables:
- student_name = "Emma"
- subject = "Mathematics"
- level = "Advanced"
- topic = "Calculus Derivatives"
- duration = "45 minutes"

Result: "Hello Emma, here's your personalized lesson on Mathematics at the Advanced level. Today we'll cover Calculus Derivatives with 45 minutes of content."
```

### Code Generation with Context
```
Template: "Create a {language} function to {function_purpose} for a {project_type} project. The function should handle {specific_requirements}."

Variables:
- language = "Python"
- function_purpose = "validate email addresses"
- project_type = "web application"
- specific_requirements = "multiple email formats and error handling"

Result: "Create a Python function to validate email addresses for a web application project. The function should handle multiple email formats and error handling."
```

## Best Practices

### Variable Naming
- Use descriptive, clear variable names
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Avoid special characters in variable names
- Use underscores for multi-word variables

### Template Design
- Keep templates flexible and reusable
- Provide default values when possible
- Include validation for required variables
- Consider edge cases and error handling

### Implementation
- Validate all variables before substitution
- Handle missing or invalid variables gracefully
- Use type checking for variables when appropriate
- Document all available variables and their purposes

## Common Use Cases

### Personalization
```
"Welcome back, {name}! Your last visit was on {last_visit_date}."
```

### Content Generation
```
"Generate a {content_type} about {topic} for {audience} audience."
```

### System Messages
```
"Error {error_code}: {error_message} occurred at {timestamp}."
```

### User Interface
```
"Hello {username}, you have {notification_count} new notifications."
```

## Advantages

1. **Reusability**: Same template works for multiple scenarios
2. **Personalization**: Customized responses for different users
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to update templates without changing code
4. **Scalability**: Efficient for handling large numbers of similar requests
5. **Consistency**: Maintains consistent structure while allowing customization

## Limitations

1. **Complexity**: Can become complex with many variables
2. **Validation**: Requires proper validation of variable values
3. **Debugging**: Can be harder to debug when variables are missing
4. **Security**: Need to prevent injection attacks through variables
5. **Performance**: Variable substitution adds processing overhead

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Always validate variable values
- **Sanitization**: Clean user inputs to prevent injection
- **Access Control**: Limit what variables users can modify
- **Logging**: Log variable substitutions for debugging
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle missing or invalid variables
