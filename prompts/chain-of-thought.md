# Chain-of-Thought Prompting

## Overview

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that encourages AI models to break down complex problems into smaller, logical steps and think through the reasoning process step-by-step before arriving at a final answer. This approach mimics human problem-solving by making the AI's thinking process explicit and transparent.

## Key Characteristics

- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Breaks complex problems into logical steps
- **Explicit Thinking**: Makes the AI's reasoning process visible
- **Logical Flow**: Follows a clear, sequential thought process
- **Intermediate Steps**: Shows calculations, decisions, and logic
- **Transparency**: Allows users to understand how the AI reached its conclusion

## When to Use Chain-of-Thought Prompting

- Complex mathematical problems
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Logic puzzles and brain teasers
- Problem-solving scenarios
- When you need to understand the AI's reasoning
- For educational purposes where process matters
- Debugging and troubleshooting scenarios

## Example

### User Prompt
```
Question: A shopkeeper buys an apple for $2 and sells it for $3. What is his profit?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: He buys for $2.
Step 2: He sells for $3.
Step 3: Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $3 - $2 = $1.
Final Answer: $1 profit.
```

### Expected AI Response
```
Let me solve this step by step:

Step 1: Identify the cost price
- The shopkeeper buys the apple for $2
- Cost price = $2

Step 2: Identify the selling price
- The shopkeeper sells the apple for $3
- Selling price = $3

Step 3: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Selling price - Cost price
- Profit = $3 - $2
- Profit = $1

Final Answer: The shopkeeper makes a profit of $1.
```

## Detailed Examples

### Mathematical Problem Solving
```
Question: If a train travels 120 miles in 3 hours, what is its average speed?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Distance = 120 miles
Step 2: Time = 3 hours
Step 3: Speed = Distance ÷ Time = 120 ÷ 3 = 40
Final Answer: 40 miles per hour.
```

### Logic Puzzle
```
Question: If all roses are flowers, and some flowers are red, can we conclude that some roses are red?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: All roses are flowers (given)
Step 2: Some flowers are red (given)
Step 3: Since roses are a subset of flowers, and some flowers are red
Step 4: It's possible that some roses are red, but not guaranteed
Final Answer: No, we cannot conclude that some roses are red.
```

### Word Problem
```
Question: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 to Mary and buys 3 more. How many apples does he have now?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: John starts with 5 apples
Step 2: He gives 2 to Mary: 5 - 2 = 3 apples
Step 3: He buys 3 more: 3 + 3 = 6 apples
Final Answer: John has 6 apples now.
```

## Advanced Chain-of-Thought Examples

### Complex Business Problem
```
Question: A company has 100 employees. 60% work in production, 25% in sales, and the rest in administration. If production workers earn $50/hour, sales workers earn $60/hour, and admin workers earn $40/hour, what is the average hourly wage?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate number of workers in each department
- Production: 60% of 100 = 60 workers
- Sales: 25% of 100 = 25 workers
- Administration: 100 - 60 - 25 = 15 workers

Step 2: Calculate total wages for each department
- Production: 60 × $50 = $3,000
- Sales: 25 × $60 = $1,500
- Administration: 15 × $40 = $600

Step 3: Calculate total wages and average
- Total wages: $3,000 + $1,500 + $600 = $5,100
- Average wage: $5,100 ÷ 100 = $51

Final Answer: The average hourly wage is $51.
```

### Scientific Reasoning
```
Question: If a plant grows 2 inches per week and is currently 8 inches tall, how many weeks will it take to reach 20 inches?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Current height = 8 inches
Step 2: Target height = 20 inches
Step 3: Growth needed = 20 - 8 = 12 inches
Step 4: Growth rate = 2 inches per week
Step 5: Time needed = Growth needed ÷ Growth rate = 12 ÷ 2 = 6 weeks
Final Answer: It will take 6 weeks to reach 20 inches.
```
